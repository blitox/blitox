### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working in my thesis for my PhD. My research is about active automotive suspensions systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mor things than ever like English, GitHub, Computation Fluid Dynamics and many other things 💆‍♂️. But I'll be fine!. I hope so 🤓.
- 💬 Ask me about automotive related topics. I might not know everything but we'll figure out a solution.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't know how I got to this point in my life. But I have not finished yet. I am still trying to find my purpose in this existance. 🌠🌛

### See you soon 🤙🤙🦾
